# pomclock-cwf üê∂üçÖ

I spent most of October making improvements to my existing iOS app, PomClock, as part of [CWF: Fall 2020](https://codewithfriends.io/events/cwf-fall-2020). Although I didn't accomplish my original goal of shipping v2.0 at the end of the month, I made significant progress and learned a lot more about the iOS SDK.

## The hodgepodge of the things I learned:
* How to add and configure Local Notifications 
* Drawing shapes
* Creating animations
* Presenting modals and saving their data using the Delegate design pattern
* Working with Datepickers
* Toggling light and dark appearances
* The complexities of handling view state in a UIKit app! There were more moving parts than I expected for what was intended to be a simple timer app.
